Debt Collector is a simple way to manage social micro-payments.

It's useful for house sharers, students or people who have trouble tracking how much money they've lent or borrowed to friends.

What are "social micropayments"?
  - These are things like lending someone a fiver, buying a beer, paying for the water bills.
  - They're debts and loans made between friends, which typically have 0% interest rate, and are often easy to loose track of.

How does this help?
  - Debt Collector allows you to log when friends lent you money or paid for things, or when you lent people money.
  - It then allows you to see a really simple summary of who you owe money to, who owes you, and you're overall situation (debt or credit).


TODO:
  - Natural language parser, so I can type "Bob lent me 20 pounds for bowling", and this will be understood.
  - Text message input, integrated with natural language parser, so I can log things while I'm out.
  - Network graph, showing you and your contacts and their situations. Thinking of using Canvas for this?

Colophon:
  - It's based on web.py, with some custom stuff thrown in where I didn't like the web.py way of doing it.
  - It uses MongoDB for all storage, including sessions (with a custom web.py session backend)
  - It uses some of the semantic HTML5 elements like section, header, footer etc., although maybe not how they're meant to be used - I'm still experimenting with this.


Running:
  - You need MongoDB, pymongo and web.py installed.
  - Then run mongod run &
  - Then run ./debtcollector.py to start the development server.
